# compound-eye-plotting-elife
Code for plotting parameters calculated from compound eye volumes, as published in Taylor et al. 2019 eLife

Please see the publication for a link to download the original data (Data_for_plots.zip) calculated for the publication from DataDryad.
Run PlottingCodeForBeeCE.m to plot matching (but unformatted) plots to those published in the paper using the data file. A variety of options, either at the start of the script or through, can be used to modify the plotting results. All other scripts are dependencies.

Several scripts in this repository were obtained from the Mathworks File Exchange or the Mathworks website. These files are dependencies for the scripts I wrote, although some have been modified. The original authors of those files may have given the scripts different licences from the MIT license that covers this repository, and those licenses should be followed if appropriate. 

The scripts I wrote for this project are indicated at the start of each file and are covered by the MIT licence.
